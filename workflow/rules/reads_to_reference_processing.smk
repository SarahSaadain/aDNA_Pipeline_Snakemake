#     Reads to Reference Processing Workflow
# =================================================================================================
# This file coordinates the steps for mapping aDNA reads to a reference and downstream analyses.
# Each include statement brings in rules for a specific processing or analysis step.

# Prepare the reference for mapping (indexing, etc.)
