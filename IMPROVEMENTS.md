Possible improvements

* multithread plot generation
* store output of `subprocess.run` to pipeline log (started but not 100%)
* add additional configuration options to finetune various settings for various commands (e.g. fastp)
* research usage of https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ as workflow management

Done:

* add possibility in configuration to turn on/off certain pipeline steps ->
* create a conda environment file for easy setup
